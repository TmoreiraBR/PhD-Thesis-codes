Codes for reproducing results from PhD Thesis: AUTOMATIC FLEXIBLE CONTROL OF TIDAL RANGE STRUCTURES

This repository contains codes for simulating and optimising the operation of Tidal Range Structures (TRS). All simulation models are 0D. 

Examples of control optimisation algorithims:

Two-Way Scheme: CH, CHV, EHT, EHTV, EHN, EHNV
Two-Way with Pumping Scheme: EHTP, EHTVP
