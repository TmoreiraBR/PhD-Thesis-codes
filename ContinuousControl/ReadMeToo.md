Go to Assets/Scripts for visualising the main scripts responsible for training/testing the DRL Agents. 

For training or testing, simply copy all folders in this repository > Open UnityHub -> Add **ContinuousControl** folder as new project and open it.

For hyperparameters setting, use "old" trainer config file when using ml-agents 0.22.0. For newer versions (after 0.22.0 and up to 0.26.0) use "updated" trainer config.
