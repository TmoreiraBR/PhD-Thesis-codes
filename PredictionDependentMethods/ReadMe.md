Files for Upper Bound (UB) and Real-Time (RT) control of TRS (without pumping). As a case study, the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon setup (e.g. number of turbines, wetted area, etc) is utilised.

While UB methods assume perfect forecast scenario (tidal predicstions = tidal measurements), RT methods use tidal predictions for aqcuiring best operational control heads (e.g. Hstart, Hmin) that are then applied to ocean measurements.
